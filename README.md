# Deep Neural Network
This Repository contains my personal overview of the most important model and Techniques of Deep Neural Network
and some project.

## Project:
- Binary Classification
- Multiclass Classification
- Regression


## Deep Neural Network
- DNN Step-By-Step
- Optimization (Weights, Learning Rate, Grid-Search, Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adam, Regularization, Dropout)
- Validation (Manual, Automatic, K-Fold)
- Checkpoint (Improvement, Best Model)
- Save Model (Json, Yaml)


----------------------------------
I create this repository studying books  and  take 3 Certificate about Deep Neural Network on Coursera.
